# wikipedia-user-scripts

This is my collection of [Wikipedia user scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_scripts). They make doing repetitive or complex things on Wikipedia much easier to do. The on wiki list can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BrandonXLF/scripts).

Most of them should work fine on other MediaWiki wikis, but some scripts are wiki specific. Some scripts also come with a .css file, in some cases the .css file can just be imported and the .js file isn't required.
